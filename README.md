# Looping-Counter
First little experiment combining HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
It's pretty simple, but did help me to experiment with the order in which parts of functions are executed; have to make sure that "count" variable is incremented and inserted into the innerHTML at the appropriate time in order to achieve the loop back to zero.
It is, of course, not an actual loop function, but you get what I mean :)
